# SQL-Work

Day 1 - Start time - 15:00 / End time - 21:17

Read me Activity 1 - Learning SQL language on DbDiagram.io

Read me Group work - I finished the group work using MySQL, I started understanding SQL programming using DbDiagram, but I preferred to do the work using MySQL as it would be better to be able to interconnect the tables, then I learned how to export the diagram code. I can't stand watching the table anymore.
